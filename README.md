Make sure you have NodeJS and npm installed before continuing.

Fork the repository and clone it.
Navigate to the directory with index.js and install your node modules:
```

```
The bot also requires a Discord Bot token and a Giphy Api token. In the same directory as index.js, create a file with the following text:
```
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
GIPHY_TOKEN=your_giphy_token
```
and save the file as ".env"
You can then run then bot with:
```
npm start
```
